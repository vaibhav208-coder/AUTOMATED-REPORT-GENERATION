Project Title: Automated PDF Report Generation from File-Based Data Using Python

Project Description:

This project focuses on the development of a Python script that automates the process of reading structured data from a file, performing basic to advanced data analysis, and generating a professionally formatted PDF report. The report generation is accomplished using popular Python libraries such as FPDF or ReportLab, which offer powerful features for creating custom layouts, tables, charts, and formatted text. The project simulates a common use-case in data analysis and business intelligence where stakeholders require consistent and clear documentation derived from raw data.

Objective:

The primary objective is to create a seamless, automated workflow that reads input data (e.g., from a CSV, Excel, or JSON file), processes the information, generates statistical insights, and compiles a clean and structured PDF report. The script should be user-friendly, scalable, and adaptable to various types of data inputs and reporting needs.

Data Input and Analysis:

The script begins by loading the data file using Python libraries such as pandas for structured data handling. The data can originate from formats like .csv, .xlsx, or .json. After loading the data, the script performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), which may include:

Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)

Data distribution analysis

Group-wise aggregations

Time-series analysis (if applicable)

Identification of missing or anomalous data points

The results are organized into meaningful summaries and visual representations using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn. These visualizations can then be embedded in the final PDF report.

PDF Report Generation:

Using FPDF or ReportLab, the script compiles the findings into a multi-page PDF report. This report typically includes:

A cover page with title, date, and author

A table of contents (optional)

An executive summary

Tabular summaries of the data

Visual plots (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, etc.)

Interpretations or key insights from the data

A conclusion or recommendations section

Each section is styled for clarity and professionalism, with consistent fonts, headings, page numbers, and section breaks. The script supports dynamic text generation based on the actual contents of the dataset.

Deliverables:

A fully functioning Python script that automates the full process: data loading → analysis → report generation

A sample input file (e.g., sample_data.csv) for demonstration

A sample PDF report showing the output of the script

Inline code comments and documentation for easy customization

Optional Enhancements:

Add interactivity to select columns for reporting using command-line arguments or config files

Incorporate real-time charts via matplotlib and save them directly to the PDF

Schedule automatic report generation using a cron job or a task scheduler


Output:-
